# Robotic Hand :mechanical_arm:

"Where we're going, we don't need hands" - Doc :rocket:

## Description

This project was originally made for an engineering design class, but I have continued to work on it since the field of wearable technology and biomimetric robotics is fascinating to me. The current version has three fingers, but as the fingers become smaller I plan on increasing this number to five to better mimic a human hand.

## Current Iteration

This iteration is controlled by an Arduino Uno, and is almost entirely 3D printed outside of the motors and bevel gears. The hand was modelled in Fusion 360

## Future Iterations

One of my main goals is to allow the hand to require as few non 3D printed parts as possible. I expect that with the use of higher resolution resin 3D printers this can be achieved. The motors would be the only purchased parts, and usually only cost between $1-$2.

- Swap joint pins for 3D printable alternatives
- Add internal fixtures for servo motors
- Decrese length and width of each finger joint
- Experiment with ways to fasten bevel gear to pin
  - Tape/Glue (Current)
  - Keyed slot
  - Interference fit (Possibly easiest but can slip)
  - Non-circular pin
